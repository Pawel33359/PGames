# PGames

This is my personal project. In this project you can play: snake and tetris(to be finished). This project was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other than basic movement, you can change speed of the game(two different speeds are in config.js) and pause the game. Additionally it's responsive to window screens of different sizes.
